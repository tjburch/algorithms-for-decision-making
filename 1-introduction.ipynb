    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "4 sources of uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outcome uncertainty - effects of actions are uncertain\n",
    "2. Model uncertainty - model of problem is uncertain\n",
    "3. State uncertainty - true environment is uncertain\n",
    "4. Interaction uncertainty - behavior of other agents acting in the environment is uncertain\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Several examples given\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aircraft avoidance\n",
    "- Automated driving\n",
    "- Breast cancer screening\n",
    "- Financial consumption\n",
    "- Distributed wildfire surveillance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explicit programming - direct, good for simple problems\n",
    "2. Supervised learning - generalizable algorithm from examples\n",
    "3. Optimization - specify decisions strategies and maximize a performance metric\n",
    "4. Planning - a form of optimization that uses problem dynamics to guide the search\n",
    "5. Reinforcement learning - decision-making strategy is learned while agent interacts with world\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 History\n",
    "\n",
    "Historical applications in economics, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, engineering, mathematics, operations research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Societal Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "It's pretty much all over now. I wouldn't be reading this book otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "5 parts to the book\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reasoning about uncertainty\n",
    "2. Decision making as sequential problems\n",
    "3. Model uncertainty\n",
    "4. State uncertainty\n",
    "5. Contexts with multiple agents"
